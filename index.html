        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The Dovahkiin is the player's character and main protagonist 
          of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In Dovahzul, the dragon language, 
          Dovahkiin translates to "Dragonborn", meaning they have the body 
          of a human but the soul of a dragon. As such, Dovahkiin is uniquely 
          attune to The Voice, or magical shouts of great power. They use these 
          shouts as well as their unrivaled combat prowess to defeat any who oppose them, 
          including the dragons that currently terrorize the people of Skyrim. In fact, 
          Dovahkiin is prophesied to be a legendary dragon slayer, and humanities' only 
          hope in defeating the world eater, Alduin. Dovahkiin also has the ability to 
          consume the souls of slain dragons, which make him stronger and give him 
          further insight into The Voice.
